# Waffle

Waffle is a command line project manager app. It operates as a vault for your
projects and tasks.

## Set Up

    go get github.com/BrianHicks/waffle

To set up, run `waffle init`. Waffle will ask you some questions and then
generate a config file.

## Saving and Syncing

Waffle uses git to store and sync your projects. You'll just need to have git
available in your `PATH` to do it.
